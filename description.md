Motivitation Behind The Project
-------------------------------
We felt the need to automize the appointment creating process of SUST Medical Center so that it becomes very easy to schedule appointments and communicate with the 
doctor efficiently. Students actually don't get to know enough about the facilities of the Medical Center and thus when in need, they can't leverage those facilities enough.
We created this app to let the students get all the information regarding the facilities very quickly so that they don't miss out on them when they are in dire need.
