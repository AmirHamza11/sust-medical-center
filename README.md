Server Application 
------------------
We created a server application for our app and it helps to delete previous day applications and add a new day to make new appointments. It's meant to do this task everyday once. As we couldn't deploy this app to the cloud, we will manually run this server app everyday.  
Here is the link to it's github repository: [SUST Medical Center App Server](https://github.com/AmirHamza11/SUST-Medical-Center-Server)
